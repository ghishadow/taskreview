Taskreview
----------

Review Taskwarrior tasks, utilizing the GTD methodology.

Taskreview provides an efficient way to review Taskwarrior tasks using keyboard shortcuts and commandline.

Along with Asanawarrior, this is the system that I'm using to manage Asana tasks for dgraph.io. We use GTD methodology for the entire team.
